## First-time setup — save player ID to flash

Before flashing the main firmware, write a unique player ID (0–15) into NVS flash. This survives power cycles and firmware updates.

1. Open `setupid/setupid.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Set `PLAYER_IDD` to the device's unique number:
   ```cpp
   const int PLAYER_IDD = 1; // unique per device
   ```
3. Flash to device — saves the ID to NVS and prints confirmation over Serial
4. Only needed **once per device**

Then flash `atoms3.ino`.

## Credentials

Edit `credentials.h` before flashing:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID     "your_network"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "your_password"
#define MQTT_HOST     "192.168.x.x"
#define MQTT_PORT     1883
```

## How to flash

**Requirements:** Arduino IDE 2.x

**Step 1 — Add ESP32 board support**

`File → Preferences` → Additional boards manager URLs:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
```
`Tools → Board → Boards Manager` → search `esp32` → install **esp32 by Espressif**.

**Step 2 — Install libraries**

`Tools → Manage Libraries`, install:
- `M5Unified`
- `IRremoteESP8266`
- `PubSubClient`
- `ArduinoJson`

**Step 3 — Select board**

`Tools → Board → esp32 → ESP32S3 Dev Module`

Settings:
- Flash Size: `8MB`
- USB CDC On Boot: `Enabled`

**Step 4 — Flash**

`File → Open` → select `atoms3.ino`, connect via USB-C, select port under `Tools → Port`, click **Upload**.

> If the board is not detected, hold `BOOT` while plugging in USB, then upload.

## Hardware pin mapping

| Function                           | Pin    | Port   |
|------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| IR TX (shoot)                      | GPIO2  | Port A |
| IR RX (hit)                        | GPIO1  | Port A |
| CAN TX                             | GPIO5  | —      |
| CAN RX                             | GPIO6  | —      |
| External shoot button (active LOW) | GPIO41 | —      |

Button A is accessed via `M5.BtnA` (M5Unified).
Both BtnA and GPIO41 trigger a shot — connect external button between G41 and GND.

---

## IR protocol

- Protocol: **NEC 32-bit**
- Transmitted value encoding:
  ```
  bits [7:4] = team_id   (4 bits)
  bits [3:0] = player_id (4 bits)
  ```
- Port A (GPIO2) transmits, Port A (GPIO1) receives on the same port
- Own `(team << 4) | playerId` filtered out on receive
- NEC repeat codes (`0xFFFFFFFF`) are ignored

---

## Weapon level system

Level advances when the server sends `weapon_upgrade`. Resets to 0 on `die`.

| Level | Shoot cooldown |
|-------|---------------|
| 0     | 2000ms        |
| 1     | 1000ms        |
| 2     | 500ms         |
| 3     | 200ms         |
| 4     | 100ms         |
| 5     | 100ms         |

> Note: Atom S3 does not have a second IR emitter. Cooldown still applies at level 5.

---

## Game modes

```cpp
enum GameType {
    GAME_DEATHMATCH      = 0,
    GAME_TEAM_DEATHMATCH = 1,
};
```

Received via `game_start` / `game_rejoin` fields: `type_of_the_game`, `team_id`, `is_friendlyfire`.  
Team assignment is forwarded to CAN bus via `CAN_GAME_TEAM`. Friendly fire is resolved server-side.

## MQTT

- Subscribes to: `device/{playerId}/command`
- Publishes events to: `device/{playerId}/event`
- Heartbeat every 6s to: `device/{playerId}/heartbeat`
- Reconnects automatically with 2s cooldown
- On connect/reconnect: sends `CAN_SYS_REGISTER` + `CAN_STATUS_ALIVE` on CAN bus
